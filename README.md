This application be used by *two groups* of people:
- **Material Buyers** - To see if the inventory is low and
  purchase additional stock 
- **Material Receivers** - To add to new inventory to stock quantity
 - **Material Users** - To use the material and reduce the inventory 
                        quantity
 


## Why create this projects?

One of the ***big problems*** at my company is 
 we are not tracking our inventory accurately. If this system is 
developed there will be more transparency on what items are 
currently in stock.
